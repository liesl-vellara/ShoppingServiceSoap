# What is ShoppingService?
It is a simple application. We had login, find, purchase and logout. It accepted any username (with conditions) and password (with conditions) and provide a sessionId. That sessionId is transfered to the find along with the item to search for. Then using the sessionId and the item name, we can try and purchase the item.
